Python-Makeflashcards
=====================

This is a python plugin for Openoffice/Libreoffice to create nice flashcards for printing from wordlists.

It works with Openoffice/Libreoffice 1-3 (makeFlashcards.py) and 
with Libreoffice 4 (makeFlashcards4.py; tested with Libreoffice 4.0.3 in Windows) .


Installation
============

Save the makeFlashcards4.py script into the scripts directory below 
Libreoffice profile directory. 

If you don't know how to find your Libreoffice user profile, refer to

https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/UserProfile

E.g. on Windows XP:

\Documents and Setting\user name\Application Data\libreoffice\4\user\Scripts\python

Quick Usage
===========

Create or load a wordlist with three fields per line, TAB separated.

Execute the script: Tools -> Macros -> Run Macro.

Open the My Macros fold.

Select the script and click Run.
